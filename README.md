# ngFrame

ngFrame is a front end for [Frame](git@github.com:jedireza/frame.git)

*Please note, this project is at a very early point.*

## Technology

|     Client     | Development |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Bootstrap      | Gulp        |
| Angular.js     | Browserify  |
| Lodash         |             |
| Font-Awesome   |             |

## Philosophy

* 'Clone' the Drywall front end and rewrite it an Angular
* Don't include a back end
* Create a website and user system.
* It's just JavaScript
* Modularise your code

And of cause: *What you create with ngFrame is more important than ngFrame.*
